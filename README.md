# Raspberry-Pi-Glossary-Flashcards
Repository containing Anki Flashcards &amp; source code to learn/revise key terms for the Raspberry Pi

## Introduction
This repository has taken definitions outlined in [Raspberry Pi Foundation's Glossary](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/glossary/) and put them into a form which can be easily learnt/revised using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> a cross platform app specifically designed for long term knowledge retention.

## Notes
Please note the modifications which have been made & where you can find updates.
1. The front of every card has "(Raspberry Pi Glossary)" appended to the end so that if you have any other words in your collection, the Raspberry Pi definition will still be added when importing it.
2. In particular for the definitions of ISP (Imaging System Pipeline & Internet Service Provider) because in the documentation there are two definitions with the same "front", we explicitly name them so both can be imported into Anki since by default it does not import duplicates. The definition for Internet Service Provider was also taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider">Wikipedia</a>.
3. Any updates or corrections to the deck will be available at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/Raspberry-Pi-Glossary-Flashcards">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Raspberry-Pi-Glossary-Flashcards</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.

Feel free to share the deck and give the repository a star so more people are likely to see this work and can get the most out of it.

## Usage
If you want to just learn the words, download <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> on your device of choice and open the .apkg file to add it into your collection. If you wish to build the deck from scratch you will need to import the .txt file via the desktop with HTML enabled and the separator to be "|".

## Potential Improvements Yet to be Made
1. To find a way to systematically pull the definitions from so that any corrections or additions are automatically updated.
2. To be able to automatically sort the cards so that the words which are used most in the glossary (or the documentation as a whole) is displayed first for the user to learn.
